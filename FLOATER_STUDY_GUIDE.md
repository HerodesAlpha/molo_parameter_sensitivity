# 📘 Floater Study Framework — Usage & Guidance

This document describes how to use `floater_study.py` to analyse the hydrostatic properties and natural periods of a semisubmersible floater.
It is intended for **Cursor AI agents and human engineers** working collaboratively.

The purpose of the script is to rapidly explore concept variations such as:

- Number of columns (6+1, 9+1,…)
- Column diameter, draft, freeboard
- Wing radii (inner/outer)
- Lower plate width and length
- Mass distribution (steel, ballast, tower, RNA)
- Natural periods (heave, pitch/roll) and GM sensitivity

This model is **first-principles, analytical, fast**, suitable for coarse sizing and sensitivity exploration.
